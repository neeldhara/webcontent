  description: "This course was a modern introduction to the field of pattern matching algorithms. These problems are among the oldest in computer science. For example, Celera Genomics used shotgun sequencing to complete the first sequenced genome. Every text editor uses the Boyer-Moore algorithm. The area remains a fertile ground for very active current research."

  badgetext: GIAN Course
  description: "This course was an introduction to the rapidly growing field of computational social choice, which -- at the intersection of computer science and economics -- deals with the algorithmic and complexity-theoretic aspects of collective decision making. This course addresses several algorithmic and complexity-theoretic themes in computational social choice."
