text: 

All slides were made either with Beamer+PGF/TikZ or Keynote. The fonts are typically free fonts picked up from the internet. When using LaTeX, I prefer to compile the math with Euler fonts. 

All the slides are on Slideshare and can take some time to load. If you follow through to slideshare, you can download the slides (all of them are PDF files) for offline viewing.

 title: "Efficient Simplification: The (im)possibilities"
 venue: IMPECS 2010
 description: This was a tutorial about upper and lower bounds in kernelization back in 2010. While the upper bounds are mostly presented the same way, you might want to look up cross-composition for the lower bounds -- while the ideas are similar, the terminology has evolved since. See the [Kernelization book](https://kernelization.ii.uib.no/) for a deep dive into both upper and lower bounds, and even coping strategies for lower bounds including Turing kernels and Lossy kernels.

 title: "Cheat Sheets for Hard Problems"
 venue: CSA, IISc 2019
 description: "The Department of Computer Science and Automation at the Indian Institute of Science has a rich tradition of hosting summer schools for undergraduate audiences. This talk was a part of the [first edition](https://events.csa.iisc.ac.in/summerschool2013/index.html) organized in 2013 and was a broad introduction to strategies for coping with NP-hardness. The remaining talks in the summer school can be found [here](https://events.csa.iisc.ac.in/summerschool2013/schedule.html). Most of them have accompanying slides and videos. You might also be interested in the subsequent editions: [2014](), [2015](), [2016](), [2017](), [2018](https://events.csa.iisc.ac.in/summerschool2018/), and [2019](https://events.csa.iisc.ac.in/summer-school-2019/)."
