  description: "This course was a modern introduction to the field of pattern matching algorithms. These problems are among the oldest in computer science. For example, Celera Genomics used shotgun sequencing to complete the first sequenced genome. Every text editor uses the Boyer-Moore algorithm. The area remains a fertile ground for very active current research."
