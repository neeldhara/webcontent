title: Sprinkles of the Sky

A dubious draft of air
comes, goes
as if wondering
if the airâ€™s welcoming

Soft rays tiptoe
by the window
as if shy
to come inside

Sprinkles of the sky
lie in drops of dew
as if captive,
somewhat pensive

And I snuggle deeper
into a distant dream
as if I could see
a better place to be

I stole the title from a phrase in <em>Hairat</em>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oz6LoxmLJTY">a song</a> that features in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anjaana_Anjaani">Anjaana Anjaani</a>. Incidentally - I am very addicted to the entire album!
