Seek poetry
in a wisp
of smoke, or
tragedy in the details
of your incompetence

stories below
newspaper headlines
peace after
the passing of deadlines

a castle
in the air
a choice
that is fair

the absence of regret
on a death bed
a reason, or otherwise
to stay alive -

and quite possibly
it shall be
a quest unfulfilled.

Find a smile instead,
and you will find
strength to stay
yet another day.
